## From musdb package readme:
#### Tracks properties

The ```Track``` objects which makes it easy to process the audio and metadata in a pythonic way:

* ```Track.name```, the track name, consisting of `Track.artist` and `Track.title`.
* ```Track.path```, the absolute path of the mixture which might be handy to process with external applications.
* ```Track.audio```, stereo mixture as an numpy array of shape `(nb_samples, 2)`.
* ```Track.rate```, the sample rate of the mixture.
* ```Track.sources```, a dictionary of sources used for this track.
* ```Track.stems```, an numpy tensor of all five stereo sources of shape `(5, nb_samples, 2)`. The stems are always in the following order: `['mixture', 'drums', 'bass', 'other', 'vocals']`,
* ```Track.targets```, a dictionary of targets provided for this track.
Note that for MUSDB, the sources and targets differ only in the existence of the `accompaniment`, which is the sum of all sources, except for the vocals. MUSDB supports the following targets: `['mixture', 'drums', 'bass', 'other', 'vocals', 'accompaniment', 'linear_mixture']`. Note that some of the targets (such as __accompaniment__) are dynamically mixed on the fly.
